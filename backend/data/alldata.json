Caution: You are about to be the center of attraction with this volumizing, lengthening &amp; curling mascara that comes with a hi-tech curved brush &amp; an extreme black formula. This magic wand easily pulls through each lash smoothly and lays down a generous amount of product in one swipe - giving your lashes a gravity defying lift, an instant curl and a dramatic voluminous look that’s smudge-proof and clump-free, lasting for 8+ hours.</p>\n<p><strong>How to Apply:</strong> Prepare for the lash lift! Hold your mascara and position the wand in such a way that the claw brush spoons the curve of your lashes. Starting from the root, sweep the wand upward, guiding the shape of your lashes. For extra definition and fullness, wiggle the brush from side to side. Apply multiple coats for volume. Now move to your lower lashes: smoothen the lashes with the hollow side of the brush, from the center to the outer corner and return towards the inner corner of the eyelid. The result: incredible control for insane lashes!</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits: </strong>Create fluttery fullness with this ergonomically curved brush with fine bristles that coats the product on to each lash giving special attention to the inner lashes, finally saving you from the struggle to maneuver it in all different angles. The ultra-creamy, fibrous texture comes in a formula that’s not too dry, not too wet, lightweight and intensely black. This unique formula also boosts the growth of your natural lashes, fuels thickness and strength on regular use.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Details:</strong> The <strong>SUGAR Uptown Curl Lengthening Mascara </strong>is paraben-free. Easy removal with warm water or makeup remover. One swipe of either loosens the film and allows the formula to slide off easily.<br> <br>Available in the shade \"<strong>01 Black Beauty (Black)</strong>\".<br><br>Made in Taiwan.<br>Net Weight: 5g<br> <br> <strong>List of Ingredients:</strong> Water, Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Synthetic Beeswax, Candelilla Cera, Polyester-5, Palmitic Acid, Paraffin, Oryza Sativa (Rice Bran) Wax, Stearic Acid, Triethanolamine, Ammonium Acrylates Copolymer, Nylon-6, Glycol Montanate, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Copernicia Cerifera Cera, Sudium Dehydrocetate, Caprylyl Glycol and Hydrated Silica.
